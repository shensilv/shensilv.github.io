# Silvia Shen - Personal website

I am a PhD student in quantitative population genetics, studying the subject from a mathematical/statistical perspective. I received my MMathPhil from Oxford in 2021 (1st in mathematics). I am interested in mathematical genetics, bioinformatics and combining maths, statistics and computational theory to develop insights in biology.
