I am a PhD student in quantitative population genetics of complex traits, studying the subject from a mathematical/statistical perspective. I received my MMathPhil from the Universtiy of Oxford in 2021 and am now at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in mathematical genetics, bioinformatics and combining maths, statistics and computational theory to develop insights in biology. This page is to document some research and other interesting personal projects.

## Current research

*These mysterious mutations...*

I am interested in figuring out what SNPs (single base-pair mutations) *actually* do. It would be very cool to be able to completely reconstruct the phenotype of a person based on purely their DNA and environment! Obviously humans are far too elaborate, but field of complex traits genetics is a vibrant and astonishing effort to work on this problem. 

My project title is officially "Harnessing genome characterisation to uncover disease mechanisms". This is a very vague title, but at the moment I am looking at functional characterisation of GWAS hits, specifically integrating different omics data using enrichment analysis (permutations, bootstrap) and trying to find something out about the disease. How I will do the latter is unclear - there is lots of work on networks and interesting pathway analysis. 

For my work on enrichment analysis and integration of multi-omics data, look [here](enrichment.md)
