# Silvia Shen personal website - Welcome to my page 

I am a PhD student in quantitative population genetics, studying the subject from a mathematical/statistical perspective. I received my MMathPhil from the Universtiy of Oxford in 2021 and am now at the University of Edinburgh. I am interested in mathematical genetics, bioinformatics and combining maths, statistics and computational theory to develop insights in biology. This page is to document some research and other interesting personal projects.

## Current research

Statistical genetics:

*Harnessing structural genome characterisation to uncover disease mechanisms*

## Publications
