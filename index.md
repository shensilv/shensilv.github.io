# Welcome to my page

I am a first year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, doing research in statistical genetics. This page is to document some research and other interesting personal projects.

## Current research

Statistical genetics:

*Harnessing structural genome characterisation to uncover disease mechanisms*

## Publications

**2021**

Lovell-Read, Francesca A., Shen, Silvia, Thompson, Robin. “Estimating Local Outbreak Risks and the Effects of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions in Age-Structured Populations: SARS-COV-2 as a Case Study.” Journal of Theoretical Biology, 2021, p. 110983., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2021.110983.

## Previous research

### Masters research projects

Computational psychology: 

*Applying Markov decision problem and optimal control theory methods to the stag hunt game to phenotype Autism Spectrum Condition*

Bioinformatics:

*Predicting local secondary structure in the SARS-CoV-2 genome using dynamic programming methods*

### Undergraduate research projects

Epidemiology:

*Using meta-population models to determinee the probability of a major outbreak of infectious disease*

## Some fun things
